# LeagueStats

LeagueStats is an app which lets you check recent League of Legends game statistics, ranked queue positions, champion win rates and the challenger ladder.

Unfortulatelly, RIOT recently changed their policies and now has a very strict rate limits which makes me unable to access their servers without having a server of my own which would cache most of the data in order to keep the requests towards RIOT servers inside the limit, hence I stopped working on it for now.
